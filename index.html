				<h3>About Myself</h3>
				  <div class="about-text">
						<p>Hello everyone! My name is Ian Charles Hank and I am a 20 year old guy from Pennsylvania. I am a mostly self taught programmer
              with some schooling. I fell in love with computer science back in middle school and have been trying to make that my career
              since. I began just writing Hello World in a bunch of different languages and my interest grew from there. My best known
              language is Java. My only real schooling comes from West Virginia University where I have taken some engineering classes
              as well as multiple Computer Science classes. The primary language taught was Java so a good portion of my learning started
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also got very interested in the web design aspect of programming. I taught myself HTML5, CSS3, and some JS. I knew many
              people who wanted their own website plus I could make it cheap or even free just because I would enjoy designing them. Free
              practice anyways right? I began designing and finishing multiple, high quality, modern front end designed sites. This included
              hosting in different ways as well.
            </p>
