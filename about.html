					<p>Hello world! My name is Ian Charles Hank and I am a 20 year old college student from Pennsylvania. I fell
            in love with Computer Science in middle school when I began writing Hello World in various different languages.
            My interests grew from there and computer science has been my focus ever since.

      <h3>Java and OOP</h3>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>My best known language is Java. My academic classes began in high school with AP Computer Science and then continued at West
            Virginia University. Through my secondary education I have taken Engineering and Computer Science courses consisting of data
            structures and design where the primary language taught was Java. I have the most experience in Object Oriented Programming
            languages and can adapt to learn any others that will be valuable for my future.
          </p>
        </div>
      <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>I became very interested in the web design aspect of programming where I taught myself HTML5, CSS3, and JS. I began designing
             and finishing multiple, high quality, and modern front end designed sites for others which included hosting as well. My next steps
             include learning C# and more about Microsoft's .NET framework.
