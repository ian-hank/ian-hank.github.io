			<h3>About Myself</h3>
				<div class="about-text">
					<p>Hello world! My name is Ian Hank and I am a 21 year old guy from Lancaster PA. I fell
            in love with Computer Science back in middle school when I began writing "Hello World" in various different languages.
            My interests grew from there and computer science has been my focus ever since. I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate student 
            at West Virginia University for Management Information Sciences and Computer Science. My idea or challenge for this website was to 
            use zero frameowrks or libraries and focus on pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
          </p>

      <h3>Software Design and OOP</h3>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>My education is mostly object oriented programming and Java based deisgn. My academic classes began in high school with AP Computer Science and then continued at West
            Virginia University. Through my secondary education I have taken Engineering and Computer Science courses consisting of data
            structures and design where the primary language taught was Java. I have the most experience in Object Oriented Programming
            languages and can adapt to learn any others that will be valuable for my future. My education has allowed me to problem sovle software/design problems fast and efficiently.
          </p>

      <h3>Stack Web Design</h3>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>I became very interested in the web design aspect of programming rather early. I began designing and finishing high quality
             and modern front-end designed sites for others which included hosting as well. As of recently I have begun to learn Flutter 
             and Dart for the frontend of my new project. The backend is a Spring Boot, Maven, MongoDB, and Java Web API/Database. You can learn 
             more about this project on the portfolio page.
