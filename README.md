# Version History

**0.1:**
Begun on 1-27-2020. First basic layout was designed and setup. Websites skeleton HTML is put forth and first version of the website is complete.

**1.0:**
First finished design of the website. Website is fully functional and styled properly. All text has been filled in and the website takes the modern, minimal design that was desired. 

**TODO:**
I need to fill in text with more realistic responses and about me sections. Finish the homepage to add some type of content or button redirects to other other pages. Clean up code in HTML and CSS docs. Add comments and documentation as well.

**1.1:**
Website includes buttons on home page to redirect to about and projects page. CSS and HTML docs were cleaned up, documented, and commented properly. Website is fully functional and up and running. Some styles and coloring were changed as well as some mobile formatting and margins of pages. 

**TODO:**
Add some way of contact? Maybe a contact page with some sort of styled form. Finish filling in text with proper text.

**1.2:**
Added proper buttons to the home page for Resume, Email, GitHub, and LinkedIn. Updated all the text on about and projects page. Decided to just use an email button
instead of a full contact form. 

**TODO:**
Should update the fonts on the project cards. Possibly adjust or change the background colors for buttons or homepage.
